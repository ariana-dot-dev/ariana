# Terminal Stuttering Performance Fix Summary

## Problem
The new version (workspace1) experienced severe stuttering when Claude Code agents were running in custom terminals, while the old version (workspace1_old_no_perf_issue) ran smoothly.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **CRITICAL: Rust-side Force Full Screen Updates** - Changed from incremental updates to full screen updates
2. **Event Listener Management Complexity** - Changed from single listeners to array-based listeners with complex cleanup logic
3. **Synchronous Event Processing with Throttling** - Added throttling that caused event backlog
4. **Expensive Array Operations** - Memory management code that spliced large arrays on every update
5. **Excessive Logging and Benchmarking** - Performance tracking code that ironically hurt performance

## Changes Made

### 1. **MOST CRITICAL: custom_terminal.rs (Rust side)**
- **Fixed:** Changed `self.build_screen_events(true)` back to `self.build_screen_events(false)`
- **Impact:** This was forcing full screen updates on every terminal event instead of incremental updates
- **Result:** Massive reduction in data transfer and processing overhead
- Removed event benchmarking code that was adding print statements every 2 seconds
- Cleaned up extra thread formatting

### 2. CustomTerminalAPI.ts
- Reverted from `Map<string, UnlistenFn[]>` back to `Map<string, UnlistenFn>` (single listeners)
- Simplified cleanup logic - removed forEach loops and excessive logging
- Removed "CRITICAL FIX" code that was causing more problems than it solved
- Restored simple, direct event listener management

### 3. ClaudeCodeAgent.ts
- Removed screen update throttling (`SCREEN_UPDATE_THROTTLE_MS`)
- Removed event counting and benchmarking code
- Removed expensive array splicing for memory management (1000 line limit)
- Changed back to async event processing
- Simplified array operations - using spread operator instead of complex logic
- Removed setTimeout wrappers that were delaying event processing
- Removed performance measurement code

### 4. CustomTerminalRenderer.tsx
- Removed `cleanupOldStates()` function that was trying to manage memory
- Removed `requestAnimationFrame` wrapper for scrolling (direct assignment is faster)
- Removed excessive logging comments

### 5. ProcessManager.ts
- Removed `startMemoryLogging()` function that wasn't in the original version

## Key Principle Applied
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" - We removed all the "optimizations" that were actually causing performance degradation. The original simple approach was more performant.

## Result
The code now matches the cleaner patterns from the old version while preserving the new features. The stuttering should be eliminated by these critical fixes:

**Primary Fix (Rust side):**
- Restored incremental terminal updates instead of full screen dumps
- Eliminated massive data transfer overhead between Rust and JavaScript

**Secondary Fixes (JavaScript side):**
- Reducing main thread blocking
- Eliminating event processing delays  
- Removing unnecessary array operations
- Simplifying the event flow

## Testing Recommendations
1. Launch a Claude Code agent and verify smooth terminal output
2. Check that all terminal features still work (scrolling, text selection, etc.)
3. Monitor for any memory leaks over extended usage
4. Verify agent commands still process correctly
