# Terminal Stuttering Performance Fix Summary

## Problem
The new version (workspace1) experienced severe stuttering when Claude Code agents were running in custom terminals, while the old version (workspace1_old_no_perf_issue) ran smoothly.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Event Listener Management Complexity** - Changed from single listeners to array-based listeners with complex cleanup logic
2. **Synchronous Event Processing with Throttling** - Added throttling that caused event backlog
3. **Expensive Array Operations** - Memory management code that spliced large arrays on every update
4. **Excessive Logging and Benchmarking** - Performance tracking code that ironically hurt performance

## Changes Made

### 1. CustomTerminalAPI.ts
- Reverted from `Map<string, UnlistenFn[]>` back to `Map<string, UnlistenFn>` (single listeners)
- Simplified cleanup logic - removed forEach loops and excessive logging
- Removed "CRITICAL FIX" code that was causing more problems than it solved
- Restored simple, direct event listener management

### 2. ClaudeCodeAgent.ts
- Removed screen update throttling (`SCREEN_UPDATE_THROTTLE_MS`)
- Removed event counting and benchmarking code
- Removed expensive array splicing for memory management (1000 line limit)
- Changed back to async event processing
- Simplified array operations - using spread operator instead of complex logic
- Removed setTimeout wrappers that were delaying event processing
- Removed performance measurement code

### 3. CustomTerminalRenderer.tsx
- Removed `cleanupOldStates()` function that was trying to manage memory
- Removed `requestAnimationFrame` wrapper for scrolling (direct assignment is faster)
- Removed excessive logging comments

## Key Principle Applied
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" - We removed all the "optimizations" that were actually causing performance degradation. The original simple approach was more performant.

## Result
The code now matches the cleaner patterns from the old version while preserving the new features. This should eliminate the stuttering issues by:
- Reducing main thread blocking
- Eliminating event processing delays
- Removing unnecessary array operations
- Simplifying the event flow

## Testing Recommendations
1. Launch a Claude Code agent and verify smooth terminal output
2. Check that all terminal features still work (scrolling, text selection, etc.)
3. Monitor for any memory leaks over extended usage
4. Verify agent commands still process correctly
