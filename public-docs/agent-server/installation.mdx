The Ariana Agent Server allows you to run AI agents on your own cloud VMs or local machines. The agent server comes with a CLI that makes installation and management straightforward.

<Note>
Your machine must be publicly accessible and reachable over the internet.
</Note>

## Quick Install (Recommended)

The easiest way to install the agent server is through the Ariana app:

1. Open the Ariana app
2. Click the top-left menu
3. Go to **Custom Machines**
4. Click **Add**

This generates a dynamic one-liner installation script that's valid for 60 minutes. The script automatically installs everything and connects to your Ariana account.

## Install and Connect via CLI

Alternatively, you can install the CLI manually. The Ariana Agent Server is managed through the Ariana CLI. Install the CLI first:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ariana-dot-dev/agent-server/releases/latest/download/install-cli.sh | sudo bash
```

**What this does:**

1. Detects your platform (Linux/macOS) and architecture (x64/ARM64)
2. Downloads the appropriate CLI binary from GitHub releases
3. Installs it to `/usr/local/bin/ariana`
4. Makes it executable and verifies the installation

After installation, you'll have access to the `ariana` command for managing your agent server.

<Warning>
Some `ariana` commands may require sudo access to manage system services and install dependencies.
</Warning>

## Post-Installation

### Connect to Ariana

After installing the CLI, connect your machine to your Ariana account using a registration token:

```bash
ariana connect --token <YOUR_TOKEN>
```

Get your registration token from the Ariana app: **Top-left menu → Custom Machines → Add**.

This will:
1. Register your machine with Ariana
2. Install the agent server
3. Install required dependencies (Git, GitHub CLI, Node.js, Claude Code CLI)
4. Start the agent server automatically
