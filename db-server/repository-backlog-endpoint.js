// SECURITY: Removed vulnerable URL-based endpoint
// URL-based endpoints allow unauthorized access to other users' repositories
// Use /api/repository/backlog-id with secure random IDs instead

// This file is kept for reference but the endpoint has been removed for security
// The secure ID-based endpoint is implemented in the main server file
