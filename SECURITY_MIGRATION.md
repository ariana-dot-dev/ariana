# Security Migration: Repository Access Control

## Overview
This migration removes vulnerable URL-based repository access and implements secure ID-based endpoints to prevent unauthorized access to other users' repositories.

## Security Vulnerability Fixed
**Issue**: URL-based endpoints allowed potential unauthorized access to any repository by guessing/enumerating repository URLs.

**Example of vulnerable access**:
```
GET /api/repository/backlog?git_repository_url=https://github.com/other-user/private-repo
```

## Security Solution Implemented
**New approach**: Use secure random repository IDs that cannot be guessed or enumerated.

**Secure access flow**:
1. Frontend gets repository info by URL (authorized check)
2. Backend returns repository record with secure `random_id` (only for authorized users)
3. Frontend uses `random_id` for subsequent API calls
4. Backend validates user access to repository before returning data

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Vulnerable Endpoints
- ❌ `/api/repository/backlog` (URL-based) - **REMOVED**
- ✅ `/api/repository/backlog-id` (ID-based) - **SECURE**

### 2. Updated Frontend Flow
**Before (vulnerable)**:
```typescript
backlogService.getBacklogByRepository(project.gitOriginUrl)
```

**After (secure)**:
```typescript
const repository = await backlogService.getRepositoryByUrl(project.gitOriginUrl);
if (repository) {
  const items = await backlogService.getBacklogByRepositoryRandomId(repository.random_id);
}
```

### 3. Files Modified
- `db-server/repository-backlog-endpoint.js` - Removed vulnerable endpoint
- `frontend/tauri-app/src/components/CollectiveBacklogManagement.tsx` - Updated to use secure flow
- `frontend/tauri-app/src/services/BacklogService.ts` - Removed vulnerable method
- `frontend/tauri-app/src/services/ApiConfig.ts` - Updated endpoint configuration

## Security Benefits
1. **Access Control**: Only authorized users can access repository data
2. **Enumeration Protection**: Random IDs prevent guessing repository endpoints
3. **Audit Trail**: All access goes through authorization layer
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own repositories

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] User can access their own repository backlog
- [ ] User cannot access other users' repositories
- [ ] Repository creation still works
- [ ] Task creation validates repository access
- [ ] Error handling for unauthorized access

## Migration Notes
- The backend still expects `git_repository_url` for task creation (marked for future migration)
- `getRepositoryByUrl()` method performs authorization check before returning repository data
- All URL-based repository access has been removed from the codebase
