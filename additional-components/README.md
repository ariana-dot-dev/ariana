# Additional Components

This folder contains audio feature components that will be integrated into the main Ariana IDE project.

## Structure

- `audio/` - Audio feature implementation
  - `components/` - React components for audio UI
  - `services/` - Audio processing and management services  
  - `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `utils/` - Audio utility functions

## Integration Plan

These components are designed to be merged into the main project structure:
- Audio components → `frontend/tauri-app/src/audio/`
- Canvas integration → `frontend/tauri-app/src/canvas/`
- State management → `frontend/tauri-app/src/state/`
- Services → `frontend/tauri-app/src/services/`

## Cleanup

This folder should be removed after successful integration.
