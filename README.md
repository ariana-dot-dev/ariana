Ariana was almost entirely built with Ariana.

## Overview

You can run parallel coding agents that can edit code, manage github, setup a dev environment, run the code, test features in the desktop using computer use, all in the background from Hetzner VPSs, using the anthropic agent SDK.

## Features

Some nice features include: 

- mention github issues
- auto branch creation, naming, auto-commit, and even auto-push (if a PR is open on the agent's branch), with self documentation
- setup automations to run scripts when an agents starts, does a commit...
- since agents run on VPSs, run docker compose, host things publicly. we even generate https certs for you
- agents can spawn other agents, manage agents, and environments, automations
- agents forking to keep a copy of the disk, of chrome logins and od the context over multiple agents 
- gaming-grade desktop streaming for each agents
- beautiful markdown & mermaid rendering
- nice diffs view using Pierre Computer's diffs.com
- web previews, desktop streaming, desktop use to test agent's changes

## Installation

It's quite unpractical to setup Ariana for now as there are a lot of 3rd party services and custom infra needed to make it work, but we will try to improve this asap.

Here is a checklist of dependencies and setup steps you would roughly need:
